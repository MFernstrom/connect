## Overview
Connect is a tool for testing the security posture of internal environments by simulating
real world tactics performed by threat actors. It features an extensible command set and
server architecture to deploy and maintain agents for multiple languages and platforms.
This extensibility provides operators the ability to rapidly conduct and repeat specific
scenarios.

Connect is only to be used for legal applications when the explicit permission of the targeted
organization has been obtained.
